#### Breaking v0.5.1

- [#110](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/pull/110) Breaks the `SRC14` abi by adding the `proxy_target()` function. This will need to be added to any SRC14 implementation. The new abi is as follows:

```sway
abi SRC14 {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn set_proxy_target(new_target: ContractId);
    #[storage(read)]
    fn proxy_target() -> Option<ContractId>;
}
```
